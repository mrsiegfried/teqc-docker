# TEQC & runprk00 in CentOS Docker

#### Edited by M.R. Siegfried (siegfried@mines.edu) 2 Feb 2022

Annoyed that `runpkr00` doesn't work on 64-bit machines or Apple Silicon? This is for you. This let's you build and launch a Docker image that has `teqc` and `runpkr00` installed, along with a shell script `trim2dat_folder.sh` that will run `runpkr00` on all `.T0*` files in the folder you currently reside. 

I will keep adding helper shell scripts as I have time (or send a pull request with new scripts. I will at some point test this for _offline_ use to make sure we can keep using this while we are in Antarctica. Thanks to Kiya Riverman for making me get off my butt to deal with a `runprk00` solution (and of course thanks to the four-year-ago insight of sean0921 to build this Dockerfile, from where I forked the initial code)

* TEQC - The Toolkit for GPS/GLONASS/Galileo/SBAS/Beidou/QZSS/IRNSS Data 
  + According to [FAQ by UNAVCO](https://www.unavco.org/software/data-processing/teqc/faqs/faqs.html)
    - non-free software (closed source)
    - free to use now (freeware)

* How to use with remote docker image:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -v ~/:/home/user --name runpkr00 --platform linux/amd64 mrsiegfried/teqc-runpkr00:master
```

* How to use with local docker image:

```sh
docker build -t runpkr00 .  # execute from the directory with Dockerfile to build a docker image
docker run -it --rm -v ~/:/home/user runpkr00  # run the docker image you just created
```

* Test the docker container to make sure it runs teqc and runpkr00
```
teqc +help      #test teqc command
runpkr00        #test runpkr00 command
man runpkr00    #you can see manual of runpkr00 if you need
```

if output help message shows, you can use it! Some notes on the flags:

* `-it` 	access container in interactive mode
* `--rm` 	removes container when you exit/stop
* `-v`		mount a host folder. Above mounts `~/` from the host folder (your home directory) to `/home/user` which is the container home directory. So you can call folders like you would normally on your computer with a ~/. But you can adjust the mount and destination however you want (e.g., need to mount an external volume with T00 files).
* `--name` give the container a name (in this case `runpkr00` for obvious reasons. If you are going to run a bunch of these containers, just let Docker name your containers.
* `--platform` use a specific platform (in this case `linux/amd64`

Execute Environment in Docker:

  + CentOS 7
  + You can change the Dockerfile to test in different environment
